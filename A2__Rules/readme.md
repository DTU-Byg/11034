# A2: Rules

In this assignment you will: design and write an IFC rule in Python for each of the Gather, Generate and Analyze use case segments (3 rules in total). The assignment can be done just using the RWTH viewer. However for some cases, i.e. when we try and use more than one model, we need to setup our own python / ifcopenshell development environment.

Therefore the core of the assignment is:  **For each of the three rules, produce 1  x A4 description and 1 a4 that include the code snippet. Therefore, the assignment report should include 6 pages in total.**

|Name         | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1     | Gather case description       |
| 2  | Gather case snippet        |
| 3   | Generate case description       |
| 4   | Generate case snippet       |
| 5   | Analyse case description       |
| 6   | Analyse case snippet     |


This should be submitted as a pdf / doc / docx / ods / odt Please be careful with the snippets and test them. I should be able to copy and paste them into my RWTH viewer - please test this! I Have about 120 of these to test so if we have to do the indenting for every rule it will take forever.

Because of this and because some of you may be using the python command line rather than RWTH you also have the option to include code folders for each of your use cases. Then inside each folder you would save a main.py file and your models folder. **So your final submission would be a zip folder that would include 3 code folders and your report**. *Refer to the IFC Rules document for specifications on the folder structure*. 

just in case I'll repeat it here. *folders* in italics

*BIM_USE_NAME*
	*model*
		Duplex_A_20110907.ifc
	main.py

Even if you are just using the RWTH viewer you could copy your snippet code from RWTH into a text / .py file and put this into the code folder. Then I would be able to easily check the code without having to guess the indentation
