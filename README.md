# 11034 Advanced Building Design

The course is divided into 5 modules, each module builds on the previous one to guide you through identifying your use case and the data you need to analyse to create your tool or workflow. The course focuses on the IFC schema to provide you with a robust future proof and interoperable understanding of BIM.

## Learning Objectives
1. Analyse a current BIM use case in BPMN.
2. Propose a tool or workflow for a BIM use case in BPMN
3. Design rules to check conformance of an IFC model
4. Identify, locate and extract the required information for the proposed use case from an IFC model
5. Evaluate an IFC model and provide appropriate feedback / guidance for a specific use case and user.
6. Evaluate the suitability of software licensing options for digital tools.
7. Design an OpenBIM tool or workflow to address the challenges of a specific use case based on international and national standards and best practice.

##  BIM Awesome
We are at an exciting point in BIM at the moment, it is a real moment where the future is being defined in front of our eyes. We are trying to bring together some of these developments in a list repo called [bim awesome](https://dtu-byg.github.io/BIM-awesome/).

## Standards
This course is possible because of a large community of humans who have been passionate about supporting standards in the AEC for a very long time. The main organisation representing these people and the needs for standardisaiton in the AEC is the awesome [BuildingSmart](https://www.buildingsmart.org/). BuildingSmart are responsible for the development of several core interoperability tools that make this course possible they include. The table below shows the 5 main standards supported by BuildingSMART.

The idea would be to create a smaller specific model that captures just the information they need. The reality is that this is quite difficult to produce which it is possible is the reason there are few approved MVD instances. ||

## Code examples
The super exciting thing about this course is that it tries to move from the old way of running linear courses, where students repeat the same standard exercise each year and try and change it.
