# Advanced Building Information Modelling [11034](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2021-2022/11034)

The course is divided into 5 modules, each module builds on the previous one to guide you through identifying your use case and the data you need to analyse to create your tool or workflow. The course focuses on the IFC schema to provide you with a robust future proof and interoperable understanding of BIM.

Learning Objectives
1. Analyse a current BIM use case in BPMN.
2. Propose a tool or workflow for a BIM use case in BPMN
3. Design rules to check conformance of an IFC model
4. Identify, locate and extract the required information for the proposed use case from an IFC model
5. Evaluate an IFC model and provide appropriate feedback / guidance for a specific use case and user.
6. Evaluate the suitability of software licensing options for digital tools.
7. Design an OpenBIM tool or workflow to address the challenges of a specific use case based on international and national standards and best practice.
