# A3: Use Case
We want you to focus on Advanced BIM isnâ€™t about going in and changing everything all at once, but really focusing on a specific use case and getting that right and in the process setting up the foundations to support work in further use cases without actually doing it. In this way we reduce the potential to overstretch and also provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate the potential value that you offer to a company quickly and in a controlled space. 

We are also really interested in presenting BIM as a method for you to explore the things that interest you. Therefore, in this assignment we want you to identify 2 use cases that you are really passionate about and want to explore further. One of these will end up being the one that you choose in your final project.

In this assignment you will dig deeper into use cases and some tools and standards to support this and develop two BIM use case that extends provide a real example of a BIM use that you can then use to develop your final project (you will choose one of these BIM uses for the final project). 

*Therefore the core of the assignment is:*  For each of the two selected use cases, produce An A4 report. Therefore, the assignment report should include as many pages as are required to concisely convey your use cases.

| For each use case upload                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Â·    Report (documenting sections 1,2,3,5,6,7)  o   Use_case_report_Team_XX.pdf  Â·    Information exchange excel sheet (for section 4)  o   Use_case_INFX_Team_XX.xlsx  Â·    Bpmn file of current use case (redrawn by you) + BPMN file for your proposed  tool   o   NAME_OF_USE_CASE_Team_XX.bpmn  o   NAME_ OF_PROPOSED_PROCESS_Team_XX.bpmn |

## What to actually submitâ€¦.

 

For each of your chosen use cases, write a report based on the BIM Execution Plan from Penn State. However our report is a bit different as it includes the plan for the development of a new tool / workflow. It should include the following stages.

**1) Goal**

Goal of the tool / workflow in one sentence.

i.e. to support the user to calculate the total total cost of the project.

**2) Model Use (Bim Uses)**

Please refer initially to the **Mapping BIM uses, use cases and processes** section in this document.

**3) Process**

1) model the process diagram from your use case in BPMN.io please remember to save the .bpmn file and you can save a .svg file that you can insert into your report.![img](file:///C:/Users/ADMIN-~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png)

2) description of the **process** of your tool / workflow

Link to original process maps [here](https://psu.pb.unizin.org/app/uploads/sites/189/2019/05/Template-Process-Maps-V2-0-MS-Powerpoint-Format.ppt).

**4) Information Exchange**

Fill out the excel template with the information for your planned tool / workflow. For this you will need access to the excel, which we will provide ASAP and the Dikon document to help you specify the LOD (LOR,LOG,LOI) for each element you need for you tool / workflow. This can get confusing - donâ€™t worry we can help ðŸ˜Š

**5) Your tool / workflow**

â€‹     Description of how your tool / workflow would solve the use case

**6) IFC**

Describe the IFC entities and properties for each of the elements you identified in your information exchange.

**7) How you would make it (tool development methodology)**

Description of how you would make the tool / workflow - what steps would you go through?
