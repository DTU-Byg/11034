# 3. Use Case
>Advanced BIM isnâ€™t about changing everything at once. It is about focusing on a specific use case, and starting to think about how you would test a potential solution to that use case before you build thee solutions. It is about considering, the information that you need - what can you get from the IFC for instance? 

In this way, this assignment focuses provides an opportunity to clearly scope your ambition and motivation for your OpenBIM workflow / tool. Reducing the potential  to overstretch and providing an opportunity to demonstrate the potential value that you offer to a company quickly in a controlled space. 

We are also really interested in presenting BIM as a method for you to explore the things that interest you. Therefore, in this assignment we want you to identify 2 use cases that you are really passionate about and want to explore further. One of these will end up being the one that you choose in your final project.

## Content
In this assignment you will dig deeper into use cases and some tools and standards to support this and develop two BIM use case that extends provide a real example of a BIM use that you can then use to develop your final project (you will choose one of these BIM uses for the final project). We will also introduce the concepts and tools of [IDM](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/information-delivery-manual/).

## Assignment Format
*Therefore the core of the assignment is:*  For each of the two selected use cases, produce a readme.md in markdown. Therefore, the assignment report should include as many Format: there are three options. 
1. a pdf of the usecase
2. a markdown file of the use case - this would be best, check out this [awesome markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)

## Assignment should include                           
1.  Report (documenting sections 1,2,3,5,6,7)  
1.  Use_case_report_Team_XX.pdf
2.  Information exchange excel sheet (for section 4)  
3.  Use_case_INFX_Team_XX.xlsx  
4.  BPMN file of current use case (redrawn by you) + BPMN file for your proposed  tool
5.  NAME_OF_USE_CASE_Team_XX.bpmn  
6.  NAME_ OF_PROPOSED_PROCESS_Team_XX.bpmn 

## The report

You should produce a report for each of your chosen usecases this should be written in markdown. The contents of the report are based on a hybrid of full Information delivery manuals,  the BIM Execution Plan from Penn State and common development methodologies  from computer science. in this sense, teh use case report you will produce for this assignment is special as it includes the plan for the development of a new tool / workflow. It should include the following stages.

| # |Part|Description|Resources|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|**Goal**|Goal of the tool / workflow in one sentence. i.e. to support the user to calculate the total total cost of the project.||
|2|**Model Use (Bim Uses)**|Please refer initially to the **Mapping BIM uses, use cases and processes** section in this document.||
|3|**Process**| 1. model the process diagram from your use case in BPMN.io please remember to save the .bpmn file and you can save a .svg file that you can insert into your report. 2. description of the **process** of your tool / workflow. | Link to original process maps [here](https://psu.pb.unizin.org/app/uploads/sites/189/2019/05/Template-Process-Maps-V2-0-MS-Powerpoint-Format.ppt). |
|4|**Information Exchange**| Fill out the excel template with the information for your planned tool / workflow. For this you will need access to the excel, and the Dikon document to help you specify the LOD (LOR,LOG,LOI) for each element you need for you tool / workflow. This can get confusing - donâ€™t worry we can help ðŸ˜Š | Dikon document describing the LOD etc. used in Denmark. Excel document (find link for this.......) |
|5|**Your tool / workflow**| Description of how your tool / workflow would solve the use case| Examples from previous years.... |
|6|**IFC**| Describe the IFC entities and properties for each of the elements you identified in your information exchange.| |
|7|**Delivery**| Description of how you would make the tool / workflow - what steps would you go through? |  |
