	W1 'What is BIM?' 
		BIM Maturity levels - intro
		This is the 'what is BIM' Lecture - can this be prerecorded??
		NIST tool (excel) to analyse an IFC (we provide)
		Here we need to cover the big challenges. 
		
			intro
				challenges
				previous work from 11034 + thesis qs. (state of art)
				
			
			get reqs - rules
				avoid silos - build elems
				testing - unit test / test based development etc.
			
			break it down into small parts
				flexible and auto
				segments layers / perspectives
				
			reconfigurable - BPMN....
			non linear design for CC etc.
		
	W2 IFC / OPEN BIM etc.
		map the values in Revit so they appear correctly in IFC (check it)
		# i can autocheck this...!!!!!
		(they will need to start thinking about)
	
# Cycle 2: Rules (3 WEEKS)

	W3 Python and IFCopenshell
		introduce python
		introduce ifcopenshell
	W4 Python / IfcOpenShell / Build code to check their models from Cycle 1 - what model?
	W5 Assessment - LOD rule checking - poss LOD?? I can give examples.
	
# Cycle 3: Use Case (3 WEEKS)
	W6 BIM Maturity levels - how can we tell? - IfcOpenShell hack
	W6 Solibri ....
	W7 ISO 19650?? Emma??
	W7 BPM and BIM, possibly SOA? / EA?
	W7 Speckle?? - Dynamo etc. interoperability (TDMC)
	w8 BIM Use Cases / BS UCM / TDMC Framework
	w8 Assessment - use case modelling - DEF USE CASE FOR FINAL PROJ
	W8 Optimisation / automation
	
# Cycle 4: Web based (2 WEEKS)
	W9 IFC_JSON
	W10 LD - possibly - maybe they choose??
	
# Cycle 5: Final (3 weeks)
	ASSESSMENT ADD TO ECO SYSTEM.
	REPORT DOCUMENTING THE NEW TOOL.
		Examples:
			LOD:			Make rules for Dikon LOD
							does it work.... check in ifcopenshell
			Game:			explain a weird BIM concept.
			Meta: 			ontology to fit on top of IFC.
							does it work.... check in ifcopenshell
			MVD/IDM: 		data exchange / custom schema
			ML / ROBOTS:	3DCP?? i also need to talk about this..
